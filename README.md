Last Updated Jan. 27, 2023

This repository contains all the example and exercise code for the MESA Front-End Development Skills Lab.
There are three sections:

  1. **HTML** - Learn how to create the "skeleton" of a webpage. Understand common elements and their attributes.
  2. **CSS** - Learn how to style the "skin" of a webpage. Basic concepts include selectors, <div> containers, box model, flexbox, and media queries.
  3. **JavaScript** - The "muscles" of a webpage. Learn how to use JS to turn static webpages into something more dynamic and interactive. Use the HTML Document Object Model of a webpage to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
